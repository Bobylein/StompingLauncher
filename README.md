**The Stomping Launcher** is a tool for the dinosaur survival game [The Stomping Land](http://www.thestompingland.com/) with the aim of making joining and hosting servers easier for those not familiar with command line parameters.

# Download: 

Current version (v0.2): https://github.com/chrmoritz/StompingLauncher/releases

# Features:

### 1. Join Server by IP
* join every community/private server with only knowing their ip address (or dns name/url)
  * even if the server isn't listed in the server list
* manage a history/server list of your favorite community/private servers with the ability to:
  * reorder and remove server from the list
  * connect to any server from your history
  * and of course add new server to your server list

### 2. Host your Own Server
* easily change your server configuration by (un)checking checkboxes:
  * enable/disable friendly fire, show all player names and remove dinosaur
* simply edit host options like:
  * hostname, port, public (steam) visibility, steam query port and choose a custom configuration directory
* ability to auto-join your server on startup (if you host it on a local pc)
* support for multiple server profiles (save and load your server options)
* Note: if you want your server be public available make sure you forward the port and steamQueryPort and have a steam client running on your computer (needed for serverlist visibility)

### 3. Start serverbased Singleplayer / LAN
* instead of playing in build-in solo modus play a serverbased singleplayer game with the following advantages
  * working expertise and weapons saving
    * continue where you left the last time (Note: atm similar to current multiplayer games base and dinosaur saving isn't working)
  * one click hosting for LAN games (for more options use the host server tab and uncheck steam server list)
    * other players can join your server by entering your local network ip in the join server tab

### 4. Savefile editor
* easily edit your servers savefiles and change your players:
  * location (teleport to your friends), expertise (start with 200+), hunger
  * herbs, arrows, robe (more than ingame limits possible)
  * weapons equiped in each slot (multiple shields possible)
* copy the values of one player to another (used for teleportation)
